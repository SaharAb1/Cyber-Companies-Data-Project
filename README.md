# Cybersecurity 500 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Description

The "Cybersecurity 500 Data Analysis and Visualization" project aims to enhance, clean, and analyze a dataset of top cybersecurity companies. We will extract additional data, organize it, draw conclusions, and develop an interactive website for users to sort and visualize the information according to their needs.

## Goals

1. **Data Enrichment**
   - Collect additional data about companies (value, employee count, etc.)

2. **Data Cleaning and Organization**
   - Standardize and normalize the dataset
   - Separate city and state into distinct columns

3. **Data Analysis and Insights**
   - Categorize companies by cybersecurity sector
   - Analyze state-level data for population and economic correlation

4. **Conclusions and Recommendations**
   - Derive insights about company types and market roles
   - Provide state-level insights and recommendations

5. **Interactive Website Development**
   - Develop an intuitive website for data sorting and visualization

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Integration**
   - Use APIs and web scraping to gather additional data

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Apply data cleaning techniques for consistency

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Use statistical methods and visualization tools

4. **Advanced Data Analysis**
   - Implement machine learning algorithms for deeper insights

5. **Website Development**
   - Utilize modern web frameworks and JavaScript libraries

## Expected Outcomes

- Enhanced dataset with comprehensive information
- Analytical reports and visualizations
- Interactive website for data exploration and visualization
- Actionable conclusions and recommendations
